Notes for future work

GUI

A model can be created in pure Python code - see all the early examples.
Alternatively a simulation can be created with an xml model - this version can 
be displayed with the GUI program which follows simple rules to make the model python file
and then run it.
The Python standard library has an XML module. The ptolemy project has created a markup language
that MAY be used.


Backend System

- A model system that automatically adds all connected components into a Model which can be "Run"
